# Redux quiz group project ðŸŽ²

The task was to build a quiz game using Redux. Working as a team to use the state to render the quiz questions one at a time.The user clickes the answer and gets to know if its is correct or not before moving forward to the next question. After answering the five questions the user gets a summary and a chance to do the quiz again.

The main problem was to understand the flow of Redux and figuring out how many components we needed and where to store them.
